    "## What is RAG?\n",
    "**RAG** augments a language model with the ability to retrieve relevant documents from a knowledge base before generating answers. This prevents hallucinations and ensures answers are grounded in actual data.\n",

    "- **Retriever**: Fetch top-k most relevant chunks for a query\n",
    "- **LLM**: Generate contextual answers based on retrieved docs\n",

    "**Simple explanation:**\n",
    "Computers don't understand words like \"fee\" or \"credit card\". They only understand numbers! So we need to **translate** our text chunks into numbers (called \"embeddings\").\n",
    "\n",
    "**Think of it like this:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"What is the fee?\"       →  [0.12, -0.45, 0.78, ...]  (1536 numbers!)\n",

    "```\n",
